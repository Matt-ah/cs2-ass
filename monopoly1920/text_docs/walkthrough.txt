I created a main.py file to serve as the entry point for launching the Monopoly game. This file initializes the Tkinter GUI and instantiates the Controller class that manages game logic.

File: main.py
Key lines:
- Line 2: `from monopoly1920 import controller` imports the main Controller class
- Lines 4â€“7: Initializes Tkinter and starts the main game loop

To experience this change:
1. Run `main.py`
2. The Monopoly game window should appear and begin the first player's turn
3. From there, all GUI interactions are routed through the Controller and View classes

This addition makes it easier to launch and test the game without modifying the internal logic files like `controller.py`.

I implemented the Jail system, including rules for sending players to jail, tracking their turns, and letting them leave through various options.

Files modified:
- player.py
- controller.py

Key changes:
- player.py:
  - Added attributes: `__in_jail`, `__jail_turns`, `__get_out_of_jail_cards`
  - Added methods: `go_to_jail()`, `leave_jail()`, `is_in_jail()`, `increment_jail_turn()`, `use_get_out_of_jail_card()`

- controller.py:
  - Added logic to:
    - Send player to jail when landing on space 30 ("Go to Jail")
    - Send player to jail if they roll doubles 3 times
    - Track jail turns and allow exit via rolling doubles, paying $50 after 3 turns, or using a card
  - New method `handle_jail_turn(player)` controls jail logic per turn

I fully integrated the Jail mechanics into the actual game flow by hooking them into the player turn and dice roll systems.

Files modified:
- controller.py

Key changes:
1. **Skipping turn for jailed players:**
   - In `_roll_action(self, data)`:
     - Line added immediately after getting the current player:
```python
if player.is_in_jail():
    self.handle_jail_turn(player)
    return
```

2. **Sending player to jail if they land on 'Go to Jail' (space 30):**
   - After retrieving the current square in `_roll_action(self, data)`:
```python
if player.position == 30:
    player.go_to_jail()
    observer.Event("update_state", f"{player.name} landed on 'Go to Jail' and is sent to Jail!")
    return
```

3. **Sending player to jail after rolling doubles 3 times:**
   - Inside `_roll_dice(self)` method:
```python
if dice1 == dice2:
    self.__roll_count += 1
    if self.__roll_count >= 3:
        player = self._gameboard.get_current_player()
        player.go_to_jail()
        observer.Event("update_state", f"{player.name} rolled 3 doubles in a row and is sent to Jail!")
        self.__roll_count = 0
        return dice1, dice2
```
   - This logic ensures that repeated doubles now carry the correct penalty.
