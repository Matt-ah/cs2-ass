I used ChatGPT to help me create a main entry point for the Monopoly game. I asked for a minimal script that launches the existing Controller and GUI using Tkinter.

Prompt:
"Is the current Monopoly code enough to run the game, and how can I create a main.py file to launch it?"

ChatGPT helped me identify that a main entry point was missing and generated a basic `main.py` file:

```python
import tkinter as tk                          # Line 1
from monopoly1920 import controller           # Line 2

if __name__ == "__main__":                    # Line 3
    root = tk.Tk()                            # Line 4
    game = controller.Controller(root)        # Line 5
    root.mainloop()                           # Line 6
```

This file now serves as the main launcher for the game and simplifies testing and development.

I used ChatGPT to help me implement the full Jail system in Monopoly. This included both backend logic in the Player and Controller classes.

Prompt:
"How do I implement Monopoly jail rules including landing on Go to Jail, rolling doubles 3 times, tracking jail turns, and using Get Out of Jail Free cards?"

ChatGPT guided the following changes:
- In `player.py`, I added:
```python
self.__in_jail = False
self.__jail_turns = 0
self.__get_out_of_jail_cards = 0
```
And methods like:
```python
def go_to_jail(self): ...
def leave_jail(self): ...
def use_get_out_of_jail_card(self): ...
```

- In `controller.py`, I added:
```python
if self.__roll_count >= 3:
    player.go_to_jail()

if player.position == 30:
    player.go_to_jail()
```

- I also added a new method `handle_jail_turn()` to control logic for jail decisions (roll doubles, pay, use card).

This collaboration made it much faster to implement all jail-related functionality cleanly.

ChatGPT helped identify that I needed to:
1. Check if a player is in jail at the start of their turn and call `handle_jail_turn()`
2. Add logic for landing on square 30 (Go to Jail)
3. Add logic to track and trigger jail after 3 doubles in a row

Code added in `controller.py`:

In `_roll_action(self, data)`:
```python
if player.is_in_jail():
    self.handle_jail_turn(player)
    return
```

Also in `_roll_action(self, data)`:
```python
if player.position == 30:
    player.go_to_jail()
    observer.Event("update_state", f"{player.name} landed on 'Go to Jail' and is sent to Jail!")
    return
```

In `_roll_dice(self)`:
```python
if dice1 == dice2:
    self.__roll_count += 1
    if self.__roll_count >= 3:
        player = self._gameboard.get_current_player()
        player.go_to_jail()
        observer.Event("update_state", f"{player.name} rolled 3 doubles in a row and is sent to Jail!")
        self.__roll_count = 0
        return dice1, dice2
```

This made the jail system functional as part of the game flow and testable in regular turns.

I used ChatGPT to help me add a feature for player name selection.

I prompted: "How can I prompt for player names in a Python tkinter game?"
ChatGPT suggested modifying the _create_players() method in the Controller to use tkinter.simpledialog.askstring.

I implemented this so that each player is prompted for a name at the start of the game, defaulting to "Player X" if none is provided.
